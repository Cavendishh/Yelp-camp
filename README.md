<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
  This massive project was done at the end of Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 to showcase some of the learned tools, methods, skills, 
  and technologies during the bootcamp. The bootcamp was comprehensive and taught me a lot of modern-day web development practices. To digest 
  all that massive information took a while but I am confident this project taught me a significant amount.
